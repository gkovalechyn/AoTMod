#AoTMod - A mod for Feng's Attack on Titan Tribute Game
This mod is older than RC, just so that you know. It was added to RC a few months ago because I got hold of the project
files for the main assembly and all that stuff.

The only thing I am not going to give out are the crashes, I am also going to remove any protection against the crashes
that I know of because, you know, why give it for free? I am also not giving out the source code for the Photon library.

I will not give out the project files, because if you are looking for this, you should already know how to do that. Now, 
I don't really care about what anyone of you are going to do with this, I don't care enough about the game to keep it for
myself anymore too.
